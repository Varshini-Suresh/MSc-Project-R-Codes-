# Project title: The interplay between ageing-induced mutations and mTOR pathway deregulation in cancer development
Project supervisioned by: Dr Maria Secrier, UCL Genetics Institute

The R codes used throughout the project can be found here. 
The folders here are divided into (1) Codes as RScript files (2) RData files (3) Project Results, saved as .png files 
There is a file/code pertaining to each of the 11 cancer tissue types obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and one pertaining to a pan-cancer analysis, for each stage of the analysis. 

The analysis was conducted in 3 phases, by focusing on genes involved in different sections of the mTOR pathway:(i) genes involved in the mTORC1 complex (ii) genes involved in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes and (iii) all genes involved in the wider pathway, which includes mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, signalling pathways both upstream and downstream of the mTOR complexes

Results: Correlation analysis between level of ageing signature found in exomes and different groups of mTOR pathway activity are shown in boxplots, the groups of patients clustered into different mTOR activity groups are shown on heatmaps
